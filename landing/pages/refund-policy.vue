        <h2 class="text-h6">1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This Refund Policy explains how refunds work for paid subscriptions to Voice to Text (the "Service").
          If you have questions, contact us at
          <a href="mailto:iliyazelenkog@gmail.com">iliyazelenkog@gmail.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy does not limit any statutory rights you may have under applicable consumer protection laws.

        <h2 class="text-h6">2. Who processes payments</h2>
        <p>
          Payments for subscriptions may be processed by Paddle, our payment provider. In many cases Paddle acts as
          the Merchant of Record, meaning charges and refunds are processed through Paddle and returned to the
          original payment method when approved.

        <h2 class="text-h6">3. Refund eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          We handle refund requests on a case-by-case basis. In general, we will consider a refund if:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You request it within 14 days of the charge date</li>
          <li>The request is reasonable and not abusive or fraudulent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may decline refunds in cases of abuse, repeated refund requests, or where usage indicates the Service was
          consumed substantially.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2 class="text-h6">4. Subscriptions and cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          You can cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing
          period unless required otherwise by applicable law. Cancelling does not automatically trigger a refund for
          the current billing period.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-h6">5. How to request a refund</h2>
        <p>
          To request a refund, email
          <a href="mailto:iliyazelenkog@gmail.com">iliyazelenkog@gmail.com</a>
          and include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The email address used for the purchase</li>
          <li>The approximate charge date and amount</li>
          <li>Any receipt/invoice ID (if you have it)</li>
          <li>A short description of the issue</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a refund is approved, it will be issued to the original payment method. Processing times depend on your
          bank/card provider and may take several business days.
